# Load Balancing in Mobile Networks using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objective
This project simulates and optimizes mobile network base station load using heuristic and ML (K-Means) approaches.

## 🧠 Features
- Simulation of users and base stations
- Nearest-BS, Heuristic, and ML-based rebalancing
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Jain’s Fairness Index
  - Overload Count
  - Throughput Proxy
- Visualization of user distribution

## 🛠️ Run Instructions
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
